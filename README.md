TODO:

-   Make users take 4 pictures.
-   Each column of the result page should be for only one pose. => all those pictures under same pose name should be followed below your picture.
-   Save button should allow you to save the recently taken pictures.
-   Collect more sample pictures & Delete pictures with poses that were not well recognized.
-   Figure out how to store the pictures locally once you load it to minimize the get requests.
-   Should it dynamically show newly updated pictures when other people generate?
- Resize frame generated by holistic model for natural outline
- Change authentication service provider from auth0 to nextauth
- Deploy frontend on vercel, look for different website for deploying it on backend (deploying backend on vercel might not work as well)
